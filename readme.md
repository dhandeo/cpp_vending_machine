# Assignment

Design an API for a **vending machine** that dispenses items of your choice using **object oriented design principles**. Please provide a main.cpp with your API. You may use any programming language, but I would prefer if you **use C++** and the code compiles. List any **assumptions** in your design. I am not looking for an exhaustive design here, and you **may skip over internal the implementation** of some your member functions.
